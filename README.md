# Real-Time Data &amp; ML Infrastructure Platform

## 📌 Overview
AdStreamX is a production-grade, real-time advertising data infrastructure platform designed to simulate a large-scale ad personalization 
and ranking systems similar to those powering modern immersive platforms like Roblox.

This project demonstrates how to build:
- High-throughput streaming data pipelines
- Online + offline ML feature stores
- Scalable ad retrieval and ranking systems
- A/B experimentation frameworks
- Privacy-compliant, observable data systems

It is designed to reflect the responsibilities of a **Senior Data Engineer (Ads Infrastructure & ML Features)** role.

## Problem Statement

Modern advertising systems must:
- Process millions of real-time user interactions
- Compute low-latency ML features
- Support large-scale model training
- Enable rapid experimentation
- Maintain reliability, observability, and privacy compliance

AdStreamX simulates a full-stack ads infrastructure powering:
- Personalization
- Ranking
- Measurement
- Experimentation
